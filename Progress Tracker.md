### Session Log

**Session 1** - June 2, 2025: Articles & Case System Through Real-World Experience
- **Situation Reviewed**: Café cake mix-up (Mohnkuchen vs. Möhrenkuchen)
- **Key Discovery**: Article case system is pattern-based, not random transformations
- **Grammar Focus**: Accusative case (den falschen Kuchen), systematic article patterns
- **Vocabulary Learned**: versehentlich, bestellt, tauschen, gegen
- **Breakthrough Moment**: Understanding that articles signal noun roles, not just arbitrary changes
