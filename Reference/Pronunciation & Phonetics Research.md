- **Consonant clusters** (pf, ts, sch combinations)
- **R-sound variations** (rolled vs. uvular)

### Recommended Practice Sequence
1. **Start with minimal pairs** to establish sound distinctions
2. **Use IPA reference** for precise sound targeting
3. **Practice with Speechling** for feedback
4. **Integrate into tutor sessions** with real-word examples

### Connection to Tutor System
- **Session Integration**: Add pronunciation focus to grammar sessions
- **Real-World Practice**: Use User's daily German interactions for practice
- **Progress Tracking**: Document improvement in specific sound categories
